Many were chrome dipped plastic but this one is chrome dipped stainless steel. There are many great features, the first is construction, then the rest follow; you can change flow patterns easily and the hand held portion is sized to fit a woman's hand. The only con I have is that the hook is so tall that I can't hang it back up so I just let it hang down the bulkhead.",

My 6 year old is able to use it with ease and showers all by herself from start to finish because she knows the showerhead is GREEN when the water temperature is too hot and RED for too hot and BLUE for too cold. She loves knowing the water will always be just right when she sees the green color and never hurts herself as long as she is keeping an eye on the showerhead. No leaks, super easy to install, decently long hose. Plus, all of the spray head settings it has exceed even some of the showerheads I have throughout the house for the \"adult\" bathrooms. A+.",

I also thought it would be great if we ever lost electricity suddenly we wouldn't be plunged into darkness. We actually lost electricity for a few hours the day after I got this while showering and I was saved from an accident bease the whole bathroom was illuminated by the green LED. Sadly it only worked three days at the most. Overstock sent a replacement that I will be installing later.",

My 4 year old has banged this around a bunch already with no problems. It doesn't offer much by way of spray adjustments. There is a rain shower setting which just hurts, a massage setting which leaves you cold and then two full spray settings that seem to only vary by intensity. So if you're looking for a massager, keep looking. If you're looking for the convenience of a hand held shower that will easily translate to you and/or your toddler the water temperature, good find.",

        "Review Title": "Terrible Customer Service/Damaged Product",
        "Review Text": "I purchased my shower door & it came perfectly packed. All of the hardware was in a box with foam for each piece. My very experienced glass installer was baffled by a scraping noise coming from the one roller. He spent a lot of time trying to solve the problem w/no luck. I called Customer Service and they said to video tape the problem which I did. They emailed me back and said I received a DAMAGED roller. They were sending me a new roller. I asked for compensation for a defective part bc I am now going to have to PAY AGAIN for the installer to come out and replace THEIR DEFECTIVE PART! Their reply: We do not send out damaged items and unfortunately, we cannot always determine how or/if a part has been damaged in transit or during installation, we have offered a replacement regardless. We do however ask that the customer refrains from scheduling installers until all necessary parts for a complete installation are received and inspected for any damages/missing items. This is to prevent additional installation fees, which are out of our control. I had all the parts, they were inspected, & they are obviously in pristine condition ie..not dropped with dings The roller was not outwardly damaged at all. My installer, who does this EVERY DAY said he believes there was some kind of O ring missing on the roller. U can see there is some space in pic 1 but no space in pic 2. When a company DOES NOT stand behind their product & tries to say there is no way to know what the problem is or when it happened\u2026.STAY CLEAR! As I told customer service I have 2 more bathrooms to do and WILL NOT be using their product. When people ask me abt the door I will say it's not worth the chance. My designer, contractor and installer will also never recommend THIS COMPANY.",

The assembly instructions were very straightforward and included all the hardware necessary. The sliding door is extremely smooth and quiet. There are also adjustments incase your shower curb or floor is not level. The glass is also coated so it is more resistant to water stains. Quality product overall. I would buy again from Glass Warehouse!",

        "Review Text": "Just wanted to share my thoughts on the Glass Warehouse 56 in - 60 in x 36 in x 78 in Frameless Sliding Shower Door with Return Panel. Let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for my bathroom! First off, this shower door looks super sleek and modern. The frameless design adds a touch of elegance that instantly upgrades the whole vibe of my bathroom. It's like stepping into a fancy spa every time I take a shower! Now, let's talk about convenience. The sliding door is a dream to use. It glides effortlessly, making it a breeze to hop in and out of the shower. And the return panel? Genius! It gives me the extra space I need to move around comfortably. No more awkward showering dance moves! Size matters, and this shower door definitely delivers. With its dimensions of 56 in - 60 in x 36 in x 78 in, I finally have enough room to stretch out and enjoy my showers. It's perfect for both tall folks and those who like a little extra elbow room. When it comes to durability, this shower door doesn't disappoint. The tempered glass panels feel solid and well-made. I don't have to worry about them breaking easily or causing any accidents. Plus, installation was a piece of cake with the clear instructions provided. All in all, I can't recommend the Glass Warehouse Frameless Sliding Shower Door with Return Panel enough. It's not just about looks, but the functionality it brings to my bathroom is top-notch. Treat yourself to this upgrade and turn your shower time into a luxurious experience every day!",

        "Review Text": "The shower door's frame proved inadequate in its support, resulting in a collapse approximately a week after installation. To remedy this, my contractor resorted to using three longer nails to bolster the stability of the rail. However, the issue persists, as the door consistently slides to the left. I'm seeking guidance or assistance from either Bedbathand beyond or the shower door company. Your help is greatly appreciated.",

Having another person to handle the heave glass would of been nice but wasn't optional. The only mistak I made was I should of set the slider door in the shower area first then installed the non-slider panel.due to room constraints of not being able to move in the slider glass. So I had to remove the fixed glass then set the slider insid the shower area then reinstall the non slider after that I could install the slider door lesson learned, by the way my wife's girl friends are jealous of her new custom built walk in shower with the built in seat which caused the door issue not glass warehouse issue just a simple install miscalculation. Would I buy this product again yes, just have someone younger and stronger to help install.",

I had broken glass all over me and I was also hurt from the bruises. Infect I have permanent scares. The cause could have been that the installation wasn't done right or a manufacturer defect..who knows. Regardless I reached out to the seller and replaced the glass despite it not covered under warranty. I had the glass reinstalled but I'm still terrified so we only used that shower once. The room where the bathroom is in was converted into an airbnn and we are so worried that the glass may fall out again. I wish the company would have replaced it for a brand new style instead of the track rolling style. I gave 5 stars for service and quality.",

        "Review Text": "Fairly easy installation. Follow the directions and make sure to measure properly. I helped our contractor and he mentioned how much he liked it too. I suggest using clear silicone to seal the edge and bottom of the glass panel that stays in place (not the sliding door). I did not use the rubber pieces under the glass panel because I wanted it flush without a gap so I could seal it off. I would also use this on the metal bar that goes in front of the sliding door to help prevent water from splashing on the floor. However, the sliding door is about a 1/4 inch higher than the other glass panel which does allow some water to splash out regardless of the metal bar. You can adjust the sliding door to be higher or lower, but not low enough because it needs room to slide. Thick glass, great quality for the price.",

We had to return it b/c the frame was an inch short. I'm still not sure if it was our error or theirs. Either way, they returned it no problem and we ordered a second one that fit the space. It was great value for money if it works!",

The only thing I wish is that it was a little closer to the tile so no water every got through. But it's pretty minimal. They also supply clear plastic fittings/gaskets that help with water containment.",

        "Review Text": "I was looking for something frameless that would show off our tile and match the look of the bathroom, and this door really does that for me. It was very well packaged and arrived quickly and undamaged. My installer had to do some modifications since the door wasn't flush with the wall, and even though that caused the door to be a little uneven, it still opens very smoothly. I do wish that the hardware was closer to a champagne bronze which is what it looked like to me in the photos, but overall I'm pleased.",

Easy to install and the different colors are nice. Defog works well in the center, not so much around the perimeter. Overall, love this mirror just wish it were a bit brighter. That said, we'd still buy it again.",
